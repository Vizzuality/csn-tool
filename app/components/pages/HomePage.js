It is designed to help a range of different users from site managers to national authorities and international organisations. The CSN Tool, one of the major achievements of the Wings Over Wetlands (WOW) project, is also an important example of the added value of cooperation between likeminded conservation organisations, international conventions and agreements, governments, UN agencies and other donors.</p>

            <p>The CSN Tool supports both AEWA and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. It is also relevant to the EU Birds Directive and the Bern Conventionâ€™s Emerald Network.</p>
